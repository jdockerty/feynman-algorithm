# Feynman Algorithm

Allegedly coined in jest by [Murray Gell-Mann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Gell-Mann) to describe [Richard Feynman's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman) incredible problem solving ability, this simple algorithm can be used to solve absolutely anything!

It is very easy to remember, containing only three steps:

1) Write down the problem you are facing.
2) Think very hard about that particular problem.
3) Write down the solution!

## Example

```go
package main

import "github.com/jdockerty/feynman-algorithm"

func main() {
    // ????
    answer := feynman.Solve()
}
```
